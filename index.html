            <h2>Understanding Growth and Decay</h2>
            <p><b>Growth:</b> Let x(t) denote the amount of substance (or population) that is growing or decaying. If we assume that the time rate of change of this amount of substance, dx/dt, is proportional to the amount of substance present, then dx/dt = kx. Where, k is the constant of proportionality, which determines the rate at which the substance grows or decays. It is often referred to as the growth rate or decay rate. The assumption that x(t) is a differentiable and continuous function of time ensures that the rate of change at any given time is well-defined, and the model can be smoothly applied throughout the domain of interest.Growth occurs when the rate constant k > 0, meaning the quantity increases over time.</p>
            <p><b>Decay:</b> This refers to the process where the quantity of a substance or population decreases over time. Occurs when k < 0, meaning the quantity decreases over time.</p>
            <p><b>Formula:</b> y(t) = y(0) * e^(kt), where y(0) is the initial value, k is the rate constant, and t is time.</p>
